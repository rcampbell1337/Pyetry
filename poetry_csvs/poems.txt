When I was sick with a head cold, my headfull of pressure, my father would soak a washclothin hot water, then ball it up, ring it out. He wouldopen it above my head, then place it againstmy face like a second skin, the light around medisappearing entirely except through the spacesbetween the stitching. I would inhale the steamin that darkness, hearing his voice on the other side,otherwise almost devoid of any other bodily sensebut the warmth and depth of his voice, as ifI had already died and was on the other sideof life waiting for the sickness to lift, but I wasnt.I was still on this earth, the washcloth going coldon my face, my body still sick, and my father stillthere when I opened my eyes, as he always was,there to give me warmth before going cold again.;
Even in dreams, your father is working,and in the version youd been having for weeks,he lifts a large replica of the world, places iton his back, and because his body here defieslogic and physics, carries it up a hill, which,after you wake up, you know is a metaphorfor twelve-hour shifts, for pounding nailsinto wood, for sliding steel into slots againand again, and for the days when his backis shaped into a crooked punctuation,and his feet, marking the floor into a hieroglyph,have lost more of their purpose, becoming quietwhen he gets home, so that all you see of himis not comparisons to language, but twoswollen limbs, a body reclined on a La-Z-Boy,a father relieved to call this silence his own.;
Thisis your cupthe cup assigned to youFrom the beginning. Nay, my child, I knowHow much of that dark drink is your own brewOf fault and passion. Ages long agoIn the deep years of yesterday,I knew.This is your roada painful road and drear.I made the stonesthat never give you rest I set your friend in pleasant ways and clear,And he shall come, like you, unto my breast But youmy weary child!must travel here.This is your task. It has no joy nor grace.But is not meant for any other hand,And in my universe hath measured place.Take it  I do not bid you understand I bid you close your eyesto see my face.;

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

Her all-night melody blusheslike directions for new lovers      who are lost.Last night all she held was a hum      that ran away.She now stretches words in our broken-down carsomewhere on Valley Viewbetween Orphaned Lane       and the dead end,about hidden roads and streetsof homes for all the abandoned.I study the map when she falls from crescendo.Flashlight held by my teeth,her voice needsboth hands to trace.She leads me down paths disappearinginto blue lines holding      imaginary rivers,blacking in thin creasesand folds or contoured lines.She drones about the water. I find the blue again.My hand pressed against                        the faded shore.;

Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

Someone sprayed the big weedthat planted itself in the fractured concretebefore we could even bend our tonguesto dub it flower. Soon, all the wrong greenwill be brought to wilt.Truth is, there are many Norfolks fullof our deep hotbeds, our colorful plots. Its nothingto pass one while driving, to speed up at the firstsign of us: the rubbled lot of a First, or Second,or Seventh Baptist Church, for instancethe black dust of its crumblingnever allowed to settle. And so you rollyour windows up, tighten your holdon your breath.;

iAs a girl I followed my father to our rooftop,up the narrow stairs, close to his white hem & dark slippers.The iron steps rang with the striking of our feet.He carried a telescope, the sky was clear, the moonin eclipse. The shadow did not bloodythe surface, it smoked across the lunar terrain.We often stood on the rooftop when the housewas newly built, saw dogs running in the distanceacross the packed sand. I asked if theyd be safe he said they would look after each other. Inthe time since, a thicket of jasmine formed alongthe border of our marble yard & the air smelled sweet.iiI learned that the names of stars are in Arabic,constant and loyal, like dogs:Algol, Arrakis, Deneb, Rigel, Vega.The skies turn sometimes. On a rooftop,when sand is loosened from the desert,it approaches like a red tide & cities drown.In my time, the deployment of armies would disturbthe deep desert. My father took me to a dirt lotnear the execution square, put me on his shoulders,and pointed to the ruins there. Do you see the grave of Eve?The city turned. I have forgotten what I saw in the sand.;

To drink the perfume ofspices and not burn.

When skirted by a rivers confluence,       a mountain range, or other natural boundary,       a meadow is an optimal gathering place  lush cradle       with its own established treaty rites       of diplomacy and abundance.The word meadows English etymology       precedes the dissolution of the monasteries       and the routine cadastral measurement of land.       So it leaves a soft cast in the throat,       a taste of Edenic green in its syllables.Meadow is a woven basket       pressed under epochal currents,       reaping old arrows of hunger,       sifting hard mineral traces of appetite.A gang of fifty elk saunter       the leeward edge as one body        the last of the light hemming       across mountain crowns.The elk press, slow and deliberate,       until the meadow is defined,       a rippling frontier       between their calves       hidden in the marsh grass       and me, walking slowly backwards,       pulses thudding across       the ridges of my fists.To conceptualize the words       of faith, I was taught to       hold a phantom sword       in my hand and study the verses       by its points.An allegory of conquest       so simple a child       can understand it.       Is there a sin to avoid?       Is there a promise to believe?       Is there an example to follow?       Is there a command to obey?Many perceive heaven       in the form of a meadow. The path of righteousness       is carpeted with violet flowers. The open       field symbolizes doctrine  faith is grasses.I am too close, and have forgotten       that I am a stranger here.       Ochre ripples of hair       crest on the nearest elk.The crown of my head       is the blade tip pointing       to the dark opal of sky:       What can be inferred about the divine?;

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, and grind into red dusts. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge. The display startswith the sun, sizzling and sparking as it sinks.No holiday required for those pyrotechnics.Or for my burst of waterworks, now air-dried.;

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, and grind into red dusts. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge. The display startswith the sun, sizzling and sparking as it sinks.No holiday required for those pyrotechnics.Or for my burst of waterworks, now air-dried.;

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, and grind into red dusts. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms.

Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

Her all-night melody blusheslike directions for new lovers      who are lost.Last night all she held was a hum      that ran away.She now stretches words in our broken-down carsomewhere on Valley Viewbetween Orphaned Lane       and the dead end,about hidden roads and streetsof homes for all the abandoned.I study the map when she falls from crescendo.Flashlight held by my teeth,her voice needsboth hands to trace.She leads me down paths disappearinginto blue lines holding      imaginary rivers,blacking in thin creasesand folds or contoured lines.She drones about the water. I find the blue again.My hand pressed against                        the faded shore.;

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

Her all-night melody blusheslike directions for new lovers      who are lost.Last night all she held was a hum      that ran away.She now stretches words in our broken-down carsomewhere on Valley Viewbetween Orphaned Lane       and the dead end,about hidden roads and streetsof homes for all the abandoned.I study the map when she falls from crescendo.Flashlight held by my teeth,her voice needsboth hands to trace.She leads me down paths disappearinginto blue lines holding      imaginary rivers,blacking in thin creasesand folds or contoured lines.She drones about the water. I find the blue again.My hand pressed against                        the faded shore.;

From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, and grind into red dusts. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge. The display startswith the sun, sizzling and sparking as it sinks.No holiday required for those pyrotechnics.Or for my burst of waterworks, now air-dried.;

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls.

From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, and grind into red dusts. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge. The display startswith the sun, sizzling and sparking as it sinks.No holiday required for those pyrotechnics.Or for my burst of waterworks, now air-dried.;

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, and grind into red dusts. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms.

Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge.

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

Her all-night melody blusheslike directions for new lovers      who are lost.Last night all she held was a hum      that ran away.She now stretches words in our broken-down carsomewhere on Valley Viewbetween Orphaned Lane       and the dead end,about hidden roads and streetsof homes for all the abandoned.I study the map when she falls from crescendo.Flashlight held by my teeth,her voice needsboth hands to trace.She leads me down paths disappearinginto blue lines holding      imaginary rivers,blacking in thin creasesand folds or contoured lines.She drones about the water. I find the blue again.My hand pressed against                        the faded shore.;

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

Her all-night melody blusheslike directions for new lovers      who are lost.Last night all she held was a hum      that ran away.She now stretches words in our broken-down carsomewhere on Valley Viewbetween Orphaned Lane       and the dead end,about hidden roads and streetsof homes for all the abandoned.I study the map when she falls from crescendo.Flashlight held by my teeth,her voice needsboth hands to trace.She leads me down paths disappearinginto blue lines holding      imaginary rivers,blacking in thin creasesand folds or contoured lines.She drones about the water. I find the blue again.My hand pressed against                        the faded shore.;

Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

Her all-night melody blusheslike directions for new lovers      who are lost.Last night all she held was a hum      that ran away.She now stretches words in our broken-down carsomewhere on Valley Viewbetween Orphaned Lane       and the dead end,about hidden roads and streetsof homes for all the abandoned.I study the map when she falls from crescendo.Flashlight held by my teeth,her voice needsboth hands to trace.She leads me down paths disappearinginto blue lines holding      imaginary rivers,blacking in thin creasesand folds or contoured lines.She drones about the water. I find the blue again.My hand pressed against                        the faded shore.;

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls.

From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge.

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, and grind into red dusts. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge. The display startswith the sun, sizzling and sparking as it sinks.No holiday required for those pyrotechnics.Or for my burst of waterworks, now air-dried.;

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls.

From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, and grind into red dusts. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge. The display startswith the sun, sizzling and sparking as it sinks.No holiday required for those pyrotechnics.Or for my burst of waterworks, now air-dried.;

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, and grind into red dusts. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms.

Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge.

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

Her all-night melody blusheslike directions for new lovers      who are lost.Last night all she held was a hum      that ran away.She now stretches words in our broken-down carsomewhere on Valley Viewbetween Orphaned Lane       and the dead end,about hidden roads and streetsof homes for all the abandoned.I study the map when she falls from crescendo.Flashlight held by my teeth,her voice needsboth hands to trace.She leads me down paths disappearinginto blue lines holding      imaginary rivers,blacking in thin creasesand folds or contoured lines.She drones about the water. I find the blue again.My hand pressed against                        the faded shore.;

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

Her all-night melody blusheslike directions for new lovers      who are lost.Last night all she held was a hum      that ran away.She now stretches words in our broken-down carsomewhere on Valley Viewbetween Orphaned Lane       and the dead end,about hidden roads and streetsof homes for all the abandoned.I study the map when she falls from crescendo.Flashlight held by my teeth,her voice needsboth hands to trace.She leads me down paths disappearinginto blue lines holding      imaginary rivers,blacking in thin creasesand folds or contoured lines.She drones about the water. I find the blue again.My hand pressed against                        the faded shore.;

Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

Her all-night melody blusheslike directions for new lovers      who are lost.Last night all she held was a hum      that ran away.She now stretches words in our broken-down carsomewhere on Valley Viewbetween Orphaned Lane       and the dead end,about hidden roads and streetsof homes for all the abandoned.I study the map when she falls from crescendo.Flashlight held by my teeth,her voice needsboth hands to trace.She leads me down paths disappearinginto blue lines holding      imaginary rivers,blacking in thin creasesand folds or contoured lines.She drones about the water. I find the blue again.My hand pressed against                        the faded shore.;

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls.

From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge.

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, and grind into red dusts. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge. The display startswith the sun, sizzling and sparking as it sinks.No holiday required for those pyrotechnics.Or for my burst of waterworks, now air-dried.;

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls.

From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, and grind into red dusts. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge. The display startswith the sun, sizzling and sparking as it sinks.No holiday required for those pyrotechnics.Or for my burst of waterworks, now air-dried.;

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, and grind into red dusts. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms.

Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge.

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

Her all-night melody blusheslike directions for new lovers      who are lost.Last night all she held was a hum      that ran away.She now stretches words in our broken-down carsomewhere on Valley Viewbetween Orphaned Lane       and the dead end,about hidden roads and streetsof homes for all the abandoned.I study the map when she falls from crescendo.Flashlight held by my teeth,her voice needsboth hands to trace.She leads me down paths disappearinginto blue lines holding      imaginary rivers,blacking in thin creasesand folds or contoured lines.She drones about the water. I find the blue again.My hand pressed against                        the faded shore.;

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

Her all-night melody blusheslike directions for new lovers      who are lost.Last night all she held was a hum      that ran away.She now stretches words in our broken-down carsomewhere on Valley Viewbetween Orphaned Lane       and the dead end,about hidden roads and streetsof homes for all the abandoned.I study the map when she falls from crescendo.Flashlight held by my teeth,her voice needsboth hands to trace.She leads me down paths disappearinginto blue lines holding      imaginary rivers,blacking in thin creasesand folds or contoured lines.She drones about the water. I find the blue again.My hand pressed against                        the faded shore.;

Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

Her all-night melody blusheslike directions for new lovers      who are lost.Last night all she held was a hum      that ran away.She now stretches words in our broken-down carsomewhere on Valley Viewbetween Orphaned Lane       and the dead end,about hidden roads and streetsof homes for all the abandoned.I study the map when she falls from crescendo.Flashlight held by my teeth,her voice needsboth hands to trace.She leads me down paths disappearinginto blue lines holding      imaginary rivers,blacking in thin creasesand folds or contoured lines.She drones about the water. I find the blue again.My hand pressed against                        the faded shore.;

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls.

From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge.

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, and grind into red dusts. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge. The display startswith the sun, sizzling and sparking as it sinks.No holiday required for those pyrotechnics.Or for my burst of waterworks, now air-dried.;

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls.

From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, and grind into red dusts. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge. The display startswith the sun, sizzling and sparking as it sinks.No holiday required for those pyrotechnics.Or for my burst of waterworks, now air-dried.;

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, and grind into red dusts. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms.

Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge.

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

Her all-night melody blusheslike directions for new lovers      who are lost.Last night all she held was a hum      that ran away.She now stretches words in our broken-down carsomewhere on Valley Viewbetween Orphaned Lane       and the dead end,about hidden roads and streetsof homes for all the abandoned.I study the map when she falls from crescendo.Flashlight held by my teeth,her voice needsboth hands to trace.She leads me down paths disappearinginto blue lines holding      imaginary rivers,blacking in thin creasesand folds or contoured lines.She drones about the water. I find the blue again.My hand pressed against                        the faded shore.;

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

Her all-night melody blusheslike directions for new lovers      who are lost.Last night all she held was a hum      that ran away.She now stretches words in our broken-down carsomewhere on Valley Viewbetween Orphaned Lane       and the dead end,about hidden roads and streetsof homes for all the abandoned.I study the map when she falls from crescendo.Flashlight held by my teeth,her voice needsboth hands to trace.She leads me down paths disappearinginto blue lines holding      imaginary rivers,blacking in thin creasesand folds or contoured lines.She drones about the water. I find the blue again.My hand pressed against                        the faded shore.;

Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

Her all-night melody blusheslike directions for new lovers      who are lost.Last night all she held was a hum      that ran away.She now stretches words in our broken-down carsomewhere on Valley Viewbetween Orphaned Lane       and the dead end,about hidden roads and streetsof homes for all the abandoned.I study the map when she falls from crescendo.Flashlight held by my teeth,her voice needsboth hands to trace.She leads me down paths disappearinginto blue lines holding      imaginary rivers,blacking in thin creasesand folds or contoured lines.She drones about the water. I find the blue again.My hand pressed against                        the faded shore.;

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls.

From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge.

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, and grind into red dusts. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge. The display startswith the sun, sizzling and sparking as it sinks.No holiday required for those pyrotechnics.Or for my burst of waterworks, now air-dried.;

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls.

From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, and grind into red dusts. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge. The display startswith the sun, sizzling and sparking as it sinks.No holiday required for those pyrotechnics.Or for my burst of waterworks, now air-dried.;

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, and grind into red dusts. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms.

Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge.

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

Her all-night melody blusheslike directions for new lovers      who are lost.Last night all she held was a hum      that ran away.She now stretches words in our broken-down carsomewhere on Valley Viewbetween Orphaned Lane       and the dead end,about hidden roads and streetsof homes for all the abandoned.I study the map when she falls from crescendo.Flashlight held by my teeth,her voice needsboth hands to trace.She leads me down paths disappearinginto blue lines holding      imaginary rivers,blacking in thin creasesand folds or contoured lines.She drones about the water. I find the blue again.My hand pressed against                        the faded shore.;

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

Her all-night melody blusheslike directions for new lovers      who are lost.Last night all she held was a hum      that ran away.She now stretches words in our broken-down carsomewhere on Valley Viewbetween Orphaned Lane       and the dead end,about hidden roads and streetsof homes for all the abandoned.I study the map when she falls from crescendo.Flashlight held by my teeth,her voice needsboth hands to trace.She leads me down paths disappearinginto blue lines holding      imaginary rivers,blacking in thin creasesand folds or contoured lines.She drones about the water. I find the blue again.My hand pressed against                        the faded shore.;

Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

Her all-night melody blusheslike directions for new lovers      who are lost.Last night all she held was a hum      that ran away.She now stretches words in our broken-down carsomewhere on Valley Viewbetween Orphaned Lane       and the dead end,about hidden roads and streetsof homes for all the abandoned.I study the map when she falls from crescendo.Flashlight held by my teeth,her voice needsboth hands to trace.She leads me down paths disappearinginto blue lines holding      imaginary rivers,blacking in thin creasesand folds or contoured lines.She drones about the water. I find the blue again.My hand pressed against                        the faded shore.;

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls.

From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge.

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, and grind into red dusts. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge. The display startswith the sun, sizzling and sparking as it sinks.No holiday required for those pyrotechnics.Or for my burst of waterworks, now air-dried.;

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls.

From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, and grind into red dusts. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge. The display startswith the sun, sizzling and sparking as it sinks.No holiday required for those pyrotechnics.Or for my burst of waterworks, now air-dried.;

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, and grind into red dusts. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms.

Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge.

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

Her all-night melody blusheslike directions for new lovers      who are lost.Last night all she held was a hum      that ran away.She now stretches words in our broken-down carsomewhere on Valley Viewbetween Orphaned Lane       and the dead end,about hidden roads and streetsof homes for all the abandoned.I study the map when she falls from crescendo.Flashlight held by my teeth,her voice needsboth hands to trace.She leads me down paths disappearinginto blue lines holding      imaginary rivers,blacking in thin creasesand folds or contoured lines.She drones about the water. I find the blue again.My hand pressed against                        the faded shore.;

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

Her all-night melody blusheslike directions for new lovers      who are lost.Last night all she held was a hum      that ran away.She now stretches words in our broken-down carsomewhere on Valley Viewbetween Orphaned Lane       and the dead end,about hidden roads and streetsof homes for all the abandoned.I study the map when she falls from crescendo.Flashlight held by my teeth,her voice needsboth hands to trace.She leads me down paths disappearinginto blue lines holding      imaginary rivers,blacking in thin creasesand folds or contoured lines.She drones about the water. I find the blue again.My hand pressed against                        the faded shore.;

Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

Her all-night melody blusheslike directions for new lovers      who are lost.Last night all she held was a hum      that ran away.She now stretches words in our broken-down carsomewhere on Valley Viewbetween Orphaned Lane       and the dead end,about hidden roads and streetsof homes for all the abandoned.I study the map when she falls from crescendo.Flashlight held by my teeth,her voice needsboth hands to trace.She leads me down paths disappearinginto blue lines holding      imaginary rivers,blacking in thin creasesand folds or contoured lines.She drones about the water. I find the blue again.My hand pressed against                        the faded shore.;

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls.

From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge.

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, and grind into red dusts. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge. The display startswith the sun, sizzling and sparking as it sinks.No holiday required for those pyrotechnics.Or for my burst of waterworks, now air-dried.;

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls.

From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, and grind into red dusts. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge. The display startswith the sun, sizzling and sparking as it sinks.No holiday required for those pyrotechnics.Or for my burst of waterworks, now air-dried.;

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, and grind into red dusts. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms.

Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge.

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

Her all-night melody blusheslike directions for new lovers      who are lost.Last night all she held was a hum      that ran away.She now stretches words in our broken-down carsomewhere on Valley Viewbetween Orphaned Lane       and the dead end,about hidden roads and streetsof homes for all the abandoned.I study the map when she falls from crescendo.Flashlight held by my teeth,her voice needsboth hands to trace.She leads me down paths disappearinginto blue lines holding      imaginary rivers,blacking in thin creasesand folds or contoured lines.She drones about the water. I find the blue again.My hand pressed against                        the faded shore.;

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

Her all-night melody blusheslike directions for new lovers      who are lost.Last night all she held was a hum      that ran away.She now stretches words in our broken-down carsomewhere on Valley Viewbetween Orphaned Lane       and the dead end,about hidden roads and streetsof homes for all the abandoned.I study the map when she falls from crescendo.Flashlight held by my teeth,her voice needsboth hands to trace.She leads me down paths disappearinginto blue lines holding      imaginary rivers,blacking in thin creasesand folds or contoured lines.She drones about the water. I find the blue again.My hand pressed against                        the faded shore.;

Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

Her all-night melody blusheslike directions for new lovers      who are lost.Last night all she held was a hum      that ran away.She now stretches words in our broken-down carsomewhere on Valley Viewbetween Orphaned Lane       and the dead end,about hidden roads and streetsof homes for all the abandoned.I study the map when she falls from crescendo.Flashlight held by my teeth,her voice needsboth hands to trace.She leads me down paths disappearinginto blue lines holding      imaginary rivers,blacking in thin creasesand folds or contoured lines.She drones about the water. I find the blue again.My hand pressed against                        the faded shore.;

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls.

From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge.

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, and grind into red dusts. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge. The display startswith the sun, sizzling and sparking as it sinks.No holiday required for those pyrotechnics.Or for my burst of waterworks, now air-dried.;

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls.

From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, and grind into red dusts. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge. The display startswith the sun, sizzling and sparking as it sinks.No holiday required for those pyrotechnics.Or for my burst of waterworks, now air-dried.;

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, and grind into red dusts. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms.

Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge.

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

Her all-night melody blusheslike directions for new lovers      who are lost.Last night all she held was a hum      that ran away.She now stretches words in our broken-down carsomewhere on Valley Viewbetween Orphaned Lane       and the dead end,about hidden roads and streetsof homes for all the abandoned.I study the map when she falls from crescendo.Flashlight held by my teeth,her voice needsboth hands to trace.She leads me down paths disappearinginto blue lines holding      imaginary rivers,blacking in thin creasesand folds or contoured lines.She drones about the water. I find the blue again.My hand pressed against                        the faded shore.;

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

Her all-night melody blusheslike directions for new lovers      who are lost.Last night all she held was a hum      that ran away.She now stretches words in our broken-down carsomewhere on Valley Viewbetween Orphaned Lane       and the dead end,about hidden roads and streetsof homes for all the abandoned.I study the map when she falls from crescendo.Flashlight held by my teeth,her voice needsboth hands to trace.She leads me down paths disappearinginto blue lines holding      imaginary rivers,blacking in thin creasesand folds or contoured lines.She drones about the water. I find the blue again.My hand pressed against                        the faded shore.;

Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

Her all-night melody blusheslike directions for new lovers      who are lost.Last night all she held was a hum      that ran away.She now stretches words in our broken-down carsomewhere on Valley Viewbetween Orphaned Lane       and the dead end,about hidden roads and streetsof homes for all the abandoned.I study the map when she falls from crescendo.Flashlight held by my teeth,her voice needsboth hands to trace.She leads me down paths disappearinginto blue lines holding      imaginary rivers,blacking in thin creasesand folds or contoured lines.She drones about the water. I find the blue again.My hand pressed against                        the faded shore.;

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls.

From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge.

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, and grind into red dusts. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge. The display startswith the sun, sizzling and sparking as it sinks.No holiday required for those pyrotechnics.Or for my burst of waterworks, now air-dried.;

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls.

From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, and grind into red dusts. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge. The display startswith the sun, sizzling and sparking as it sinks.No holiday required for those pyrotechnics.Or for my burst of waterworks, now air-dried.;

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, and grind into red dusts. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms.

Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge.

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

Her all-night melody blusheslike directions for new lovers      who are lost.Last night all she held was a hum      that ran away.She now stretches words in our broken-down carsomewhere on Valley Viewbetween Orphaned Lane       and the dead end,about hidden roads and streetsof homes for all the abandoned.I study the map when she falls from crescendo.Flashlight held by my teeth,her voice needsboth hands to trace.She leads me down paths disappearinginto blue lines holding      imaginary rivers,blacking in thin creasesand folds or contoured lines.She drones about the water. I find the blue again.My hand pressed against                        the faded shore.;

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

Her all-night melody blusheslike directions for new lovers      who are lost.Last night all she held was a hum      that ran away.She now stretches words in our broken-down carsomewhere on Valley Viewbetween Orphaned Lane       and the dead end,about hidden roads and streetsof homes for all the abandoned.I study the map when she falls from crescendo.Flashlight held by my teeth,her voice needsboth hands to trace.She leads me down paths disappearinginto blue lines holding      imaginary rivers,blacking in thin creasesand folds or contoured lines.She drones about the water. I find the blue again.My hand pressed against                        the faded shore.;

Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

Her all-night melody blusheslike directions for new lovers      who are lost.Last night all she held was a hum      that ran away.She now stretches words in our broken-down carsomewhere on Valley Viewbetween Orphaned Lane       and the dead end,about hidden roads and streetsof homes for all the abandoned.I study the map when she falls from crescendo.Flashlight held by my teeth,her voice needsboth hands to trace.She leads me down paths disappearinginto blue lines holding      imaginary rivers,blacking in thin creasesand folds or contoured lines.She drones about the water. I find the blue again.My hand pressed against                        the faded shore.;

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls.

From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge.

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, and grind into red dusts. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge. The display startswith the sun, sizzling and sparking as it sinks.No holiday required for those pyrotechnics.Or for my burst of waterworks, now air-dried.;

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls.

From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, and grind into red dusts. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge. The display startswith the sun, sizzling and sparking as it sinks.No holiday required for those pyrotechnics.Or for my burst of waterworks, now air-dried.;

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, and grind into red dusts. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms.

Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge.

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

Her all-night melody blusheslike directions for new lovers      who are lost.Last night all she held was a hum      that ran away.She now stretches words in our broken-down carsomewhere on Valley Viewbetween Orphaned Lane       and the dead end,about hidden roads and streetsof homes for all the abandoned.I study the map when she falls from crescendo.Flashlight held by my teeth,her voice needsboth hands to trace.She leads me down paths disappearinginto blue lines holding      imaginary rivers,blacking in thin creasesand folds or contoured lines.She drones about the water. I find the blue again.My hand pressed against                        the faded shore.;

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

Her all-night melody blusheslike directions for new lovers      who are lost.Last night all she held was a hum      that ran away.She now stretches words in our broken-down carsomewhere on Valley Viewbetween Orphaned Lane       and the dead end,about hidden roads and streetsof homes for all the abandoned.I study the map when she falls from crescendo.Flashlight held by my teeth,her voice needsboth hands to trace.She leads me down paths disappearinginto blue lines holding      imaginary rivers,blacking in thin creasesand folds or contoured lines.She drones about the water. I find the blue again.My hand pressed against                        the faded shore.;

Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

Her all-night melody blusheslike directions for new lovers      who are lost.Last night all she held was a hum      that ran away.She now stretches words in our broken-down carsomewhere on Valley Viewbetween Orphaned Lane       and the dead end,about hidden roads and streetsof homes for all the abandoned.I study the map when she falls from crescendo.Flashlight held by my teeth,her voice needsboth hands to trace.She leads me down paths disappearinginto blue lines holding      imaginary rivers,blacking in thin creasesand folds or contoured lines.She drones about the water. I find the blue again.My hand pressed against                        the faded shore.;

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls.

From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge.

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, and grind into red dusts. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge. The display startswith the sun, sizzling and sparking as it sinks.No holiday required for those pyrotechnics.Or for my burst of waterworks, now air-dried.;

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls.

From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, and grind into red dusts. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge. The display startswith the sun, sizzling and sparking as it sinks.No holiday required for those pyrotechnics.Or for my burst of waterworks, now air-dried.;

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, and grind into red dusts. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms.

Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge.

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

Her all-night melody blusheslike directions for new lovers      who are lost.Last night all she held was a hum      that ran away.She now stretches words in our broken-down carsomewhere on Valley Viewbetween Orphaned Lane       and the dead end,about hidden roads and streetsof homes for all the abandoned.I study the map when she falls from crescendo.Flashlight held by my teeth,her voice needsboth hands to trace.She leads me down paths disappearinginto blue lines holding      imaginary rivers,blacking in thin creasesand folds or contoured lines.She drones about the water. I find the blue again.My hand pressed against                        the faded shore.;

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

Her all-night melody blusheslike directions for new lovers      who are lost.Last night all she held was a hum      that ran away.She now stretches words in our broken-down carsomewhere on Valley Viewbetween Orphaned Lane       and the dead end,about hidden roads and streetsof homes for all the abandoned.I study the map when she falls from crescendo.Flashlight held by my teeth,her voice needsboth hands to trace.She leads me down paths disappearinginto blue lines holding      imaginary rivers,blacking in thin creasesand folds or contoured lines.She drones about the water. I find the blue again.My hand pressed against                        the faded shore.;

Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

Her all-night melody blusheslike directions for new lovers      who are lost.Last night all she held was a hum      that ran away.She now stretches words in our broken-down carsomewhere on Valley Viewbetween Orphaned Lane       and the dead end,about hidden roads and streetsof homes for all the abandoned.I study the map when she falls from crescendo.Flashlight held by my teeth,her voice needsboth hands to trace.She leads me down paths disappearinginto blue lines holding      imaginary rivers,blacking in thin creasesand folds or contoured lines.She drones about the water. I find the blue again.My hand pressed against                        the faded shore.;

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls.

From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge.

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, and grind into red dusts. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge. The display startswith the sun, sizzling and sparking as it sinks.No holiday required for those pyrotechnics.Or for my burst of waterworks, now air-dried.;

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls.

From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, and grind into red dusts. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge. The display startswith the sun, sizzling and sparking as it sinks.No holiday required for those pyrotechnics.Or for my burst of waterworks, now air-dried.;

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, and grind into red dusts. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms.

Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge.

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

Her all-night melody blusheslike directions for new lovers      who are lost.Last night all she held was a hum      that ran away.She now stretches words in our broken-down carsomewhere on Valley Viewbetween Orphaned Lane       and the dead end,about hidden roads and streetsof homes for all the abandoned.I study the map when she falls from crescendo.Flashlight held by my teeth,her voice needsboth hands to trace.She leads me down paths disappearinginto blue lines holding      imaginary rivers,blacking in thin creasesand folds or contoured lines.She drones about the water. I find the blue again.My hand pressed against                        the faded shore.;

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

Her all-night melody blusheslike directions for new lovers      who are lost.Last night all she held was a hum      that ran away.She now stretches words in our broken-down carsomewhere on Valley Viewbetween Orphaned Lane       and the dead end,about hidden roads and streetsof homes for all the abandoned.I study the map when she falls from crescendo.Flashlight held by my teeth,her voice needsboth hands to trace.She leads me down paths disappearinginto blue lines holding      imaginary rivers,blacking in thin creasesand folds or contoured lines.She drones about the water. I find the blue again.My hand pressed against                        the faded shore.;

Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

Her all-night melody blusheslike directions for new lovers      who are lost.Last night all she held was a hum      that ran away.She now stretches words in our broken-down carsomewhere on Valley Viewbetween Orphaned Lane       and the dead end,about hidden roads and streetsof homes for all the abandoned.I study the map when she falls from crescendo.Flashlight held by my teeth,her voice needsboth hands to trace.She leads me down paths disappearinginto blue lines holding      imaginary rivers,blacking in thin creasesand folds or contoured lines.She drones about the water. I find the blue again.My hand pressed against                        the faded shore.;

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls.

From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge.

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, and grind into red dusts. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge. The display startswith the sun, sizzling and sparking as it sinks.No holiday required for those pyrotechnics.Or for my burst of waterworks, now air-dried.;

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls.

From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, and grind into red dusts. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge. The display startswith the sun, sizzling and sparking as it sinks.No holiday required for those pyrotechnics.Or for my burst of waterworks, now air-dried.;

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, and grind into red dusts. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms.

Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge.

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

Her all-night melody blusheslike directions for new lovers      who are lost.Last night all she held was a hum      that ran away.She now stretches words in our broken-down carsomewhere on Valley Viewbetween Orphaned Lane       and the dead end,about hidden roads and streetsof homes for all the abandoned.I study the map when she falls from crescendo.Flashlight held by my teeth,her voice needsboth hands to trace.She leads me down paths disappearinginto blue lines holding      imaginary rivers,blacking in thin creasesand folds or contoured lines.She drones about the water. I find the blue again.My hand pressed against                        the faded shore.;

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

Her all-night melody blusheslike directions for new lovers      who are lost.Last night all she held was a hum      that ran away.She now stretches words in our broken-down carsomewhere on Valley Viewbetween Orphaned Lane       and the dead end,about hidden roads and streetsof homes for all the abandoned.I study the map when she falls from crescendo.Flashlight held by my teeth,her voice needsboth hands to trace.She leads me down paths disappearinginto blue lines holding      imaginary rivers,blacking in thin creasesand folds or contoured lines.She drones about the water. I find the blue again.My hand pressed against                        the faded shore.;

Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

Her all-night melody blusheslike directions for new lovers      who are lost.Last night all she held was a hum      that ran away.She now stretches words in our broken-down carsomewhere on Valley Viewbetween Orphaned Lane       and the dead end,about hidden roads and streetsof homes for all the abandoned.I study the map when she falls from crescendo.Flashlight held by my teeth,her voice needsboth hands to trace.She leads me down paths disappearinginto blue lines holding      imaginary rivers,blacking in thin creasesand folds or contoured lines.She drones about the water. I find the blue again.My hand pressed against                        the faded shore.;

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls.

From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge.

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, and grind into red dusts. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge. The display startswith the sun, sizzling and sparking as it sinks.No holiday required for those pyrotechnics.Or for my burst of waterworks, now air-dried.;

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls.

From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, and grind into red dusts. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge. The display startswith the sun, sizzling and sparking as it sinks.No holiday required for those pyrotechnics.Or for my burst of waterworks, now air-dried.;

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, and grind into red dusts. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms.

Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge.

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

Her all-night melody blusheslike directions for new lovers      who are lost.Last night all she held was a hum      that ran away.She now stretches words in our broken-down carsomewhere on Valley Viewbetween Orphaned Lane       and the dead end,about hidden roads and streetsof homes for all the abandoned.I study the map when she falls from crescendo.Flashlight held by my teeth,her voice needsboth hands to trace.She leads me down paths disappearinginto blue lines holding      imaginary rivers,blacking in thin creasesand folds or contoured lines.She drones about the water. I find the blue again.My hand pressed against                        the faded shore.;

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

Her all-night melody blusheslike directions for new lovers      who are lost.Last night all she held was a hum      that ran away.She now stretches words in our broken-down carsomewhere on Valley Viewbetween Orphaned Lane       and the dead end,about hidden roads and streetsof homes for all the abandoned.I study the map when she falls from crescendo.Flashlight held by my teeth,her voice needsboth hands to trace.She leads me down paths disappearinginto blue lines holding      imaginary rivers,blacking in thin creasesand folds or contoured lines.She drones about the water. I find the blue again.My hand pressed against                        the faded shore.;

Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

Her all-night melody blusheslike directions for new lovers      who are lost.Last night all she held was a hum      that ran away.She now stretches words in our broken-down carsomewhere on Valley Viewbetween Orphaned Lane       and the dead end,about hidden roads and streetsof homes for all the abandoned.I study the map when she falls from crescendo.Flashlight held by my teeth,her voice needsboth hands to trace.She leads me down paths disappearinginto blue lines holding      imaginary rivers,blacking in thin creasesand folds or contoured lines.She drones about the water. I find the blue again.My hand pressed against                        the faded shore.;

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls.

From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge.

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, and grind into red dusts. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge. The display startswith the sun, sizzling and sparking as it sinks.No holiday required for those pyrotechnics.Or for my burst of waterworks, now air-dried.;

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls.

From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, and grind into red dusts. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge. The display startswith the sun, sizzling and sparking as it sinks.No holiday required for those pyrotechnics.Or for my burst of waterworks, now air-dried.;

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, and grind into red dusts. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms.

Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge.

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

Her all-night melody blusheslike directions for new lovers      who are lost.Last night all she held was a hum      that ran away.She now stretches words in our broken-down carsomewhere on Valley Viewbetween Orphaned Lane       and the dead end,about hidden roads and streetsof homes for all the abandoned.I study the map when she falls from crescendo.Flashlight held by my teeth,her voice needsboth hands to trace.She leads me down paths disappearinginto blue lines holding      imaginary rivers,blacking in thin creasesand folds or contoured lines.She drones about the water. I find the blue again.My hand pressed against                        the faded shore.;

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

Her all-night melody blusheslike directions for new lovers      who are lost.Last night all she held was a hum      that ran away.She now stretches words in our broken-down carsomewhere on Valley Viewbetween Orphaned Lane       and the dead end,about hidden roads and streetsof homes for all the abandoned.I study the map when she falls from crescendo.Flashlight held by my teeth,her voice needsboth hands to trace.She leads me down paths disappearinginto blue lines holding      imaginary rivers,blacking in thin creasesand folds or contoured lines.She drones about the water. I find the blue again.My hand pressed against                        the faded shore.;

Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;

He shot birds down in that field across the road from his house.That old man would take his shotgun,and he would unleash his dog,let her run after the falling remains of what was once a life.He assures me he isnt like other bird killers,he uses every part.A house adorned with fine feathers and mystery jerky tucked away in theback of a freezer.His dog, I named her.Beauty.I didnt teach her to kill.He was the one that told her to bite down when it wriggled on the ground.He taught her to sit when he opened the sliding door,and I was stuck on the concrete deck with her.My hands brushed over her filth like it was my own.I became one and the same with that dog.Ten years pass,and I come back to find that a now older,more aggressivedog welcomes me back into her world without hesitation.That same dog that bit down on the necks of birds and could run with truckslets me run her a bubble bath.The big native man,heavy artillery at his side,watches from the deck as his pup jumps at the hose in my hands.She rolls in the grass, lunging with no malice,and covers my hips in suds and dirt.We are one and the same.My mother tells me to ask about it,but I cant bring myself to.I already know part of the answer.He had eleven siblings.Later on in life, a wife and four children, two dogs.All in the small houses they juggled between.He needed his time alone.I dont think he ever really liked the aspect of killing.But he still sat out in the middle of nowhere,covered in bug spray and leaking of camo cloth,waiting for a deer to cross his path.I dont know how other people hunt,but my grandfather would sit in one place and wait.He must have learned how to fish first.When I was eight he took me fishing for the first time.Beauty was about a year old.That old dock reminded me of a fantasy movie.So I abandoned my pink rod and lay down, letting my hand brush the water.He tried to read to me,but he lost his voice,and I lost my ability to do anything but daydream.I wasnt allowed to be a kid most of the time.We were juggling houses and breaking boundaries the same way he had.But he taught me to daydream.Just like he taught that dog to bite,he taught me to take care of myself.If Beauty ever ran away, she would be able to live on her own.She was capable.My grandfather had lived with other people his whole life I think he was scared of forgetting who he was amidst them all.He didnt like killing,though he did love the jerky he didnt go out in the afternoon looking for birds.;

Her all-night melody blusheslike directions for new lovers      who are lost.Last night all she held was a hum      that ran away.She now stretches words in our broken-down carsomewhere on Valley Viewbetween Orphaned Lane       and the dead end,about hidden roads and streetsof homes for all the abandoned.I study the map when she falls from crescendo.Flashlight held by my teeth,her voice needsboth hands to trace.She leads me down paths disappearinginto blue lines holding      imaginary rivers,blacking in thin creasesand folds or contoured lines.She drones about the water. I find the blue again.My hand pressed against                        the faded shore.;

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls.

From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge.

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, and grind into red dusts. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge. The display startswith the sun, sizzling and sparking as it sinks.No holiday required for those pyrotechnics.Or for my burst of waterworks, now air-dried.;

North East New Territories, Hong Kongfrom the soilWe make our son. From the soil we make our son biscuits. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, and grind into red dusts. From the soil we make our son biscuits stored in ceramic bowls made with the same soil we dig, burn, grind into red dusts, which means earthly affairs, a dream in an utterance that presupposes us.day tripsYour son tugs at my sleeve, making me get him the red sugar cubes you prepared for our tea. Zest and mint. He knows Im eager to please but you notice. So you push away the red sugar cubes and give him biscuits instead. The biscuits look like tiny pebbles. These are sweet too. Tiny fingers. Tiny bites. He is always eating. The way he abandoned his bread in the bookshelf for play last time we visited. This farm, this house, his birthplace: layered red soil, ghosts, and labor in the bathtub. Sweet when taken in small doses.give and takeTake the mugwort and rub it on your skin. Take the lemongrass spray. The bugs are used to us. We are used to the bugs. They could tell you are new here so they go at you. Take the tomatoes. Its not a harvest, its an explosion from the unbroken rain. I have been eating them, only eating them for a week. Take the white corn. Eat them raw. A burst of sunshine. Take Luk Sum. Take Man Gor. Take Ling Tai. Take Fai Gei. Take Tong San. Take Ling Jie. Take other farmers in mind. Oh, take the last batch of tofu from a friends closing factory, too.strangenessThe potatoes I take home are tiny and firm, except for one. Rinsing the potato, I poke my finger through the mud-filled holes, afraid of any sign of life inside. The mud crumbles into more mud. A hollowed-out starch maze. A sign that the earth does not taste metallic. I often think I could farm, except for the snakes that might slither into village houses, except for finishing the days work before the skin-scathing noon. Sometimes, life stops changing for the smallest of reasons, such as not being able to wake up with the sun.trustOur son was born before dawn. We named him Hei Yeung, hope for the sun. I never quite trusted the hospital. We read and discussed with each other to decide on the bathtub. The what-ifs became shared. Not all of us agreed. The ones who stayed in the farmhouse helped my home birth. We do talk about everything, like the way we share our income: wage or taking from the communal safe when needed? Sometimes we lose friends with the same belief, who want it differently. But I know theyre out there, working.to yieldServesever  ourout: gunshots from unseen barracks puncture the air. Some doors do not open in the village, not just these vintage cars before us but always the fire, always the bulldozer razing the soil before it is taken from your hands. Farmers without farms. The city that could no longer feed itself collapses into your throat. My tears sell better than my crops, eh? Your mind, your body yields to the soil, despitethe day a friends farm shuts down, another celebrates a tiny harvest. Rice stalks bend slightly in giving.;
By the border, my passport sticks to my facelike a kiss,     or a slap.There are women with children who look at me but wont speak,because speaking     means worrying,and our world isnt made of worrying.Its like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesnt matteryoure cold anyway or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.They find their way through the border,I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know    you.For years now, I might not know myself withoutlooking through my bag I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,and I will remember    your name   but not you.;

From our temporary housings rooftop deck,I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.Id never mistake him for a whooping crane,but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.From up here, I get how sharks can mistakesurfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boardsfor seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of July fireworksI have to drape myself around the chimineaand list over the decks edge. The display startswith the sun, sizzling and sparking as it sinks.No holiday required for those pyrotechnics.Or for my burst of waterworks, now air-dried.;
