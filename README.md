## Project Context and Rationale
### It's time to make something a bit special, this is pyetry, my first attempt at any form of ML and it's going to generate poetry!!!

## :shipit: A Poem Generated by Pyetry :shipit:: (Watch this space!)

So this is a bit of a passion project, wayback when i was but a budding software engineer, I started trying to do some machine learning . This involved
the following of some unknown youtube tutorial with a really milquetoast, boring result that predicts cars who'll win a race????

### https://github.com/rcampbell1337/Machine-Learning -> yeah, what a snooze fest.

So why not make something now I know a bit more about what i'm doing? I've always been a bit of a poet at heart, as per my namesake Rabbie Burns. I even devoted a
Twitter profile to writing haiku's during lockdown! :blush:

> Frozen here in time,
Absorbing warmth from the world,
Revitalizing

Aside from the cringe it's pretty cute right!

## Actual end goals and description of work
So for the serious stuff there is basically two potential outcomes for this piece of work:

- It successfully generates decent poetry :thumbsup:
- It creates really crap poetry :wastebasket:

Both outcomes would be a success as it will either be cool or funny!

So there are basically 4/ 5 items of work to this project listed below:

1. Get a load of poetry from somewhere and put it into a CSV.
2. Researching and finding good documentation for ML in python.
3. Use  ML to analyse the poetry CSV and generate a poem from it.
4. Display this poem in a nice GUI.
5. (optional) Refactor the work so it isn't a jumbled mess of learning a new technology (inc. unit tests).
